Uses TypeScript/Bun runtime with TUI (Terminal User Interface) in Go\n3. Core: Modified OpenCode targeting n8n workflow JSON generation\n4. System prompts drive AI behavior specifically for n8n workflows\n5. Super Code node with 46 pre-loaded JavaScript libraries in VM safe environment\n6. Multi-language: TypeScript core, Go TUI, cloud infrastructure with SST\n\nSCALABILITY CONCERNS:\n1. Single-user focused design - no multi-tenancy architecture\n2. Local file system storage (app.json, memories.json) \n3. No database layer for user/session/workflow management\n4. Limited cloud infrastructure (appears to be proof-of-concept)\n5. TUI-centric design doesn't scale to web/API use cases\n6. No authentication/authorization system for multi-user scenarios\n\nINTEGRATION RISKS:\n1. Hardcoded n8n node type references (@kenkaiii/n8n-nodes-supercode.superCodeNodeVmSafe)\n2. Static library list in Super Code node - no dynamic loading\n3. Direct JSON workflow generation without n8n API integration\n4. No validation against n8n schema versions\n5. No automated testing of generated workflows\n\nARCHITECTURAL STRENGTHS:\n1. Provider-agnostic AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local)\n2. Modular tool system (bash, edit, grep, glob, etc.)\n3. Strong TypeScript foundations with proper error handling\n4. Client/server separation allows for future remote usage\n5. MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for extensibility",

PHASE 1 (Weeks 1-4): Fix reliability crisis with validation pipeline, automated testing, security hardening\n2. PHASE 2 (Weeks 5-12): Expand from Super Code only to 50+ n8n node types, multi-user architecture  \n3. PHASE 3 (Weeks 13-20): Enhanced UX, advanced features, enterprise security\n\nCRITICAL BLOCKERS:\n- High failure risk in JavaScript generation without validation\n- Single-user architecture with no scalability path\n- Only handles 1 of 400+ n8n node types\n\nINVESTMENT: Proceed with caution - requires 2-3 developers for 5 months to reach production readiness.
