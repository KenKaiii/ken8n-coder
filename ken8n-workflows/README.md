# ken8n-workflows

This directory contains n8n workflow JSON files generated by ken8n-coder.

## Location

üìç **Project/ken8n-workflows/** - Workflows stored within the project directory

## Purpose

- **Default output location** for all n8n workflows created by the AI agent
- **Organized workflow management** - All workflows in one convenient place
- **Security compliance** - Agent can only write to project directory

## Usage

1. AI-generated workflows are automatically saved here
2. Copy JSON files to your preferred location (like Desktop) for easy access
3. Import JSON files directly into your n8n instance
4. Workflows use the Super Code node (@kenkaiii/n8n-nodes-supercode.superCodeNodeVmSafe)

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `api-data-processing.json`
- Include the main function: `email-automation-workflow.json`
- Avoid spaces, use hyphens: `csv-to-database-sync.json`

## Super Code Node Notes

- Uses `code` parameter (not `jsCode`)
- Libraries are pre-loaded as global variables
- Never use `require()` statements
- Available libraries: lodash, axios, cheerio, dayjs, moment, uuid, papaparse, etc.

## Getting Started

Ask ken8n-coder to create workflows like:

- "Create a webhook that processes CSV data"
- "Build an email notification workflow"
- "Make an API integration workflow"

All workflows will automatically be saved to this directory!

## Moving to Desktop (Optional)

Users can manually copy workflows to ~/Desktop/ken8n-workflows/ for easier access:

```bash
cp ken8n-workflows/*.json ~/Desktop/ken8n-workflows/
```
