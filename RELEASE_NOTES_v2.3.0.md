# v2.3.0 Release Notes - Critical Workflow Debugging Fixes

## ðŸ”¥ Critical Fixes

### MCP Error Visibility (MAJOR FIX)
- **FIXED**: Agents were blind to workflow errors - now they can see EVERYTHING
- **FIXED**: Super Code syntax errors now visible with line numbers
- **FIXED**: API errors, credential issues, config problems all visible
- **FIXED**: MCP wasn't passing `includeData=true` to n8n API
- **83% smaller responses**: Reduced from 8,460 to 1,400 characters

### Workflow Structure Corrections
- **FIXED**: Removed `pinData` and `triggerCount` that broke deployments
- **CORRECTED**: `settings`, `staticData`, and `versionId` are actually allowed
- **CONFIRMED**: Webhook typeVersion 2.1 works correctly

### Installation Experience
- **IMPROVED**: Clear ASCII art banner on successful install
- **IMPROVED**: Step-by-step getting started guide
- **FIXED**: All curl installation URLs now use correct GitHub raw paths
